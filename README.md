# todoApp
- Created my very first React app!
- In this project I created a to do app which lets you add items and delete items off of a task manager
- I did this using three components. 
- Two of which are containers and the last one is a ui component.
- to change the state of the original component, I prop drilled functions into other components which then sent information back to the main component, App.js
- What I learned:
  - There are two forms of components, UI components and container components. The difference is that UI components do not contain states       while container components do.
  - I learned how to prop drill to pass state information into child components
  - Finally, I learned that functions can also be prop drilled so that child components can make changes to the parent component's state
